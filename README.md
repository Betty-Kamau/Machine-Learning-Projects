# Stock Analysis Project ðŸ“ˆ

## Overview

Welcome to the Stock Analysis Project! This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of stock prices using various machine learning and data analysis techniques. The primary goal is to leverage historical stock data to derive insights, visualize trends, and build models that assist in making informed investment decisions.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection**: Fetching historical stock data using APIs or other data sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, organizing, and transforming raw stock data for analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for columns like Close, Volume, High, and Low to understand the stock's behavior.
- **Price and Volume Trends**: Create line charts or candlestick charts to visualize Safaricom's historical stock price trends (Open, High, Low, Close) and trading volumes over time.
- **Moving Averages**: Calculate and plot moving averages (e.g., 20-day and 200-day moving averages) to identify trends and potential buy/sell signals based on Close prices.
- **Volatility Analysis**: Calculate historical volatility from High and Low prices to measure the stock's price fluctuations over time.
- **Returns Analysis**: Calculate daily or periodic returns based on Close prices to assess performance. You can also calculate cumulative returns over different time frames.
- **Volume Analysis**: Analyze trading volumes to identify patterns and trends in market participation.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilize time series analysis and build machine learning models to predict stock price movements or classify buy/sell signals based on historical price and volume data.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains historical stock data used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, EDA, model development, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for fetching data, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation scripts.
- `results/`: Store model evaluation results, plots, and visualizations.

## How to Use

1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Set up a Python environment and install the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Fetch historical stock data using APIs or relevant data sources. Save the data in the `data/` directory.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Preprocess the data, handle missing values, and generate features for analysis. Refer to the preprocessing notebooks/scripts in `notebooks/` and `src/`.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Explore data patterns and insights using the provided EDA notebooks in `notebooks/`.

5. **Modeling**:
   - Train machine learning models using the preprocessed data. Refer to the modeling notebooks/scripts in `notebooks/` and `src/`.

6. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations. Store results and plots in the `results/` directory.
